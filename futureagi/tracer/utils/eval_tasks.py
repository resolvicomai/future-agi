# Cron-side drain window — once the dispatcher has fired every
# per-span activity, the task stays in RUNNING until either the
# EvalLogger row count catches up to the expected total or no new row
# has landed for this many seconds. At that point the cron flips to
# COMPLETED and records a summary failure in ``failed_spans`` so the
# UI can surface which spans never produced a result.
#
# The threshold has to survive three stacking delays before we declare
# the drain dead: activity retries (``max_retries=3`` × ``retry_delay=60
# s`` ≈ 3 min per flaky span), Temporal task-queue backpressure when
# the worker pool is saturated (can pause a queue for many minutes
# under load), and per-activity LLM latency (multimodal audio evals
# regularly take 30–60 s each). 10 min was too tight — slow-but-live
# drains were being mis-flagged as stalled and truncated prematurely.
# 30 min is a safer default; deployments that want tighter cycles can
# override via ``EVAL_TASK_DRAIN_STALL_SECONDS``.
